This patch modifies the core so it populates the auction houses with items. It
makes the game feel a bit more like official. Items and prices are chosen
randomly based on the parameters you define. If an auction expires, auctions
are deleted quietly. AHBot will not buy it's own items, and will not receive
mail from the AH or get returned mail.

===============================================================================
~~HOW TO CONFIGURE~~
===============================================================================
Step 1.) Create a character that you are going to use as the auction house bot
         character. This character will be the auction's owner for all the
         items created by the bot.
Step 2.) Go into the realm database and note the account number for the
         character.
Step 3.) Go into the characters database and note the character's GUID.
Step 4.) Log in at least once with this character.
         (Do not change the configuration before this)
Step 5.) Tune the configuration options in the configuration file and the
         Database.

#These are the settings in the configuration file:
AuctionHouseBot.EnableSeller = 0
AuctionHouseBot.EnableBuyer = 0
AuctionHouseBot.Account = 0
AuctionHouseBot.GUID = 0
AuctionHouseBot.VendorItems = 0

AuctionHouseBot.UseBuyPriceForBuyer = 0

AuctionHouseBot.EnableSeller enables (1) or disables (0) the Seller
AuctionHouseBot.EnableBuyer enables (1) or disables (0) the Buyer
AuctionHouseBot.Account is the account number (in realmd->account table) of the player you want to run as the auction bot. Note: a value of 0 will disable the bot.
AuctionHouseBot.GUID is the GUID (in characters->characters table) of the player you want to run as the auction bot. Note: a value of 0 will disable the bot.
AuctionHouseBot.VendorItems is a boolean value (0 or 1) that indicates whether to include Vendor only items
AuctionHouseBot.LootItems  is a boolean value (0 or 1) that indicates whether to include Loot/Fish/Skin/etc. only items
AuctionHouseBot.OtherItems  is a boolean value (0 or 1) that indicates whether to include Other items not covered by the first 2
AuctionHouseBot.No_Bind is a boolean value (0 or 1) that indicates whether to include items with a bonding of 0
AuctionHouseBot.Bind_When_Picked_Up = is a boolean value (0 or 1) that indicates whether to include items with a bonding of 1
AuctionHouseBot.Bind_When_Equipped = is a boolean value (0 or 1) that indicates whether to include items with a bonding of 2
AuctionHouseBot.Bind_When_Use = is a boolean value (0 or 1) that indicates whether to include items with a bonding of 3
AuctionHouseBot.Bind_Quest_Item = is a boolean value (0 or 1) that indicates whether to include items with a bonding of 4
AuctionHouseBot.ItemsPerCycle determines how many items are added each time AHBot is run (once per minute, by default)
AuctionHouseBot.UseBuyPriceForSeller Use SellPrice (0) or BuyPrice (1) for determining prices
AuctionHouseBot.UseBuyPriceForBuyer Use SellPrice (0) or BuyPrice (1) for determining prices

#These are the settings in the Database:

#MinPrice(Color)    is the minimum price adjustment for items. For example the default is 150, which means 150%. So if an item vendors for 1g it would go to auction for a minimum of 1.5g.
#MaxPrice(Color)    is the maximum price adjustment for items.
#MinBidPrice(Color) these two control the starting bid as a percent of the buyout price. For example, if MinBidPrice is 30 and MaxBidPrice is 80 the starting bid for the auction will randomly be between 30-80% of the randomly chosen buyout price.
#MaxBidPrice(Color) these two control the starting bid as a percent of the buyout price. For example, if MinBidPrice is 30 and MaxBidPrice is 80 the starting bid for the auction will randomly be between 30-80% of the randomly chosen buyout price.
#MaxStack(Color)    is maximum stack size to create for this quality type. A value of zero will disable the maximum stack size for this quality allowing the bot to create stacks (of random size) of items as big as the item type allows.

#These are the multipliers that are applied to the vendor price for an item, that determines if AHBot will buy it or not.
